Testing: Invalid AND Divergence
============================================================
❌ Compilation FAILED (as expected for invalid input)
Error: ❌ ERROR [main.divergence[2].branch[0]]: AND divergence branch 1 must NOT end with a transition. Branches should end with steps. The transition after convergence is automatically added by the compiler.
❌ ERROR [main.divergence[2].branch[0]]: AND divergence branch 1 must end with a step, but ends with 'transition'
❌ ERROR [main.divergence[2].branch[1]]: AND divergence branch 2 must NOT end with a transition. Branches should end with steps. The transition after convergence is automatically added by the compiler.
❌ ERROR [main.divergence[2].branch[1]]: AND divergence branch 2 must end with a step, but ends with 'transition'
